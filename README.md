  - You can use it to generate the orbit camera poses and directly input to other 3D process node (e.g. GaussianSplatting and BakeTextureToMesh)
  - Example usage:

    <img src="_Example_Workflows/_Example_Outputs/Cammy_Cam_Rotate_Clockwise_Camposes.png" width="256"/> <img src="_Example_Workflows/_Example_Outputs/Cammy_Cam_Rotate_Counter_Clockwise_Camposes.png" width="256"/>

  - Coordinate system:
    - Azimuth: In top view, from angle 0 rotate 360 degree with step -90 you get (0, -90, -180/180, 90, 0), in this case camera rotates clock-wise, vice versa.
    - Elevation: 0 when camera points horizontally forward, pointing down to the ground is negitive angle, vice versa.

- **FlexiCubes**: [nv-tlabs/FlexiCubes](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/FlexiCubes)
  - Multi-View depth & mask (optional normal maps) as inputs
  - Export to 3D Mesh
  - Usage guide: 
    - *voxel_grids_resolution*: determine mesh resolution/quality
    - *depth_min_distance* *depth_max_distance* : distance from object to camera, object parts in the render that is closer(futher) to camera than depth_min_distance(depth_max_distance) will be rendered with pure white(black) RGB value 1, 1, 1(0, 0, 0)
    - *mask_loss_weight*: Control the silhouette of reconstrocted 3D mesh
    - *depth_loss_weight*: Control the shape of reconstrocted 3D mesh, this loss will also affect the mesh deform detail on the surface, so results depends on quality of the depth map
    - *normal_loss_weight*: Optional. Use to refine the mesh deform detail on the surface
    - *sdf_regularizer_weight*: Helps to remove floaters in areas of the shape that are not supervised by the application objective, such as internal faces when using image supervision only
    - *remove_floaters_weight*: This can be increased if you observe artifacts in flat areas
    - *cube_stabilizer_weight*: This does not have a significant impact during the optimization of a single shape, however it helps to stabilizing training in somecases

- **Instant NGP**: [nerfacc](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfacc)
  - Multi-View images as inputs
  - Export to 3D Mesh using marching cubes

- **3D Gaussian Splatting**
  - [Improved Differential Gaussian Rasterization](https://github.com/ashawkey/diff-gaussian-rasterization)
  - Better Compactness-based Densification method from [Gsgen](https://gsgen3d.github.io/), 
  - Support initialize gaussians from given 3D mesh (Optional)
  - Support mini-batch optimazation
  - Multi-View images as inputs
  - Export to standard 3DGS .ply format supported
  
- **Gaussian Splatting Orbit Renderer**

- **Mesh Orbit Renderer**
  - Render 3D mesh to images sequences or video, given a mesh file and camera poses generated by **Stack Orbit Camera Poses** node

- **Fitting_Mesh_With_Multiview_Images**
  - Bake Multi-View images into UVTexture of given 3D mesh using [Nvdiffrast](https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast), supports:
  - Export to .obj, .ply, .glb

- **NeuS**
  - Fit a coarse mesh from sparse multi-view images & normal maps, as little as 4 to 6 views, pretty good at reconstruct the shape from reference images but texture lacking details.

- **Deep Marching Tetrahedrons**
  - Allow convert 3DGS .ply file to 3D mesh <br>
  *Note: I didn't spent time to turn the hyperprameters yet, the result will be improved in the future!*

- **Save & Load 3D file**
  - .obj, .ply, .glb for 3D Mesh
  - .ply for 3DGS

- **Switch Axis for 3DGS & 3D Mesh**
  - Since different algorithms likely use different coordinate system, so the ability to re-mapping the axis of coordinate is crucial for passing generated result between differnt nodes.

- **[Customizable system config file](configs/system.conf)**
  - Custom clients IP address 

## Roadmap:
- [x] Add DMTet algorithm to allow conversion from points cloud(Gaussian/.ply) to mesh (.obj, .ply, .glb)

- [x] Integrate [Triplane Meets Gaussian Splatting: Fast and Generalizable Single-View 3D Reconstruction with Transformers](https://zouzx.github.io/TriplaneGaussian/)

- [x] Add interactive 3D UI inside ComfuUI to visulaize training and generated results for 3D representations

- [x] Add a new node to generate renderer image sequence given a 3D gaussians and orbit camera poses (So we can later feed it to the differentiable renderer to bake it onto a given mesh)

- [x] Integrate [LGM: Large Multi-View Gaussian Model for High-Resolution 3D Content Creation](https://me.kiui.moe/lgm/)

- [ ] Add camera pose estimation from raw multi-views images

- [ ] Add & Improve a few best MVS algorithms (e.g instant-ngp, NeuS2, GaussianPro, etc.)

- [ ] Improve 3DGS/Nerf to Mesh conversion algorithms:
  -  Support to training DMTet with images(RGB, Alpha, Normal Map)
  -  Find better methods to converts 3DGS or Points Cloud to Mesh (Normal maps reconstruction maybe?)

- Add a general SDS/ISM Optimization algorithm to allow training 3D representations with diffusion model
  - Need to do some in-depth research on Interval Score Matching (ISM), since math behind it makes perfect sense and also there are so many ways we could improve upon the result obtained from [LucidDreamer](https://github.com/EnVision-Research/LucidDreamer)
  - On Hold since runtime cost to generate an is too big (3+hours for an average RTX GPU like 3080)

## Install:

**[IMPORTANT!!!]** <br> Currently this package is only been tested in following setups:
- Windows 10/11 (Tested on my laptop)
- Ubuntu 23.10 [(Tested by @watsieboi)](https://github.com/MrForExample/ComfyUI-3D-Pack/issues/16)
- ComfyUI python_embed/Miniconda/Conda Python 3.11.x
- Torch version >= 2.1.2+cu121

<br>

Assume you have already downloaded [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) & Configed your [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive) environment.

### Install Method 0: Directly inside ComfyUI Windows Python Embeded Environment 
***Currently support: (python3.10/3.11/3.12 cuda12.1)***

First install [Visual Studio Build Tools 2022/2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools) with Workloads: Desktop development with C++ (There are a few JIT torch cpp extension that builds in runtime)
- Alternatively, according to [@doctorpangloss](https://github.com/MrForExample/ComfyUI-3D-Pack/issues/5), you can setup the c++/cuda build environments in windows by using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

Go to the Comfy3D root directory: *ComfyUI Root Directory\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-3D-Pack* and run:

```bash
# Run .bat with python version corresponding to the version of your ComfyUI python environment

# install_windows_portable_win_py310_cu121.bat
install_windows_portable_win_py311_cu121.bat
# install_windows_portable_win_py312_cu121.bat
```

### Install Method 1: Using Miniconda(Works on Windows & Linux & Mac)
***Note: [In some edge cases Miniconda fails but Anaconda could fix the issue](https://github.com/MrForExample/ComfyUI-3D-Pack/issues/49)***

#### Setup with Miniconda:
First download [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) (*One of the best way to manage a clean and separated python envirments*)

Then running following commands to setup the Miniconda environment for ComfyUI:

```bash
# Go to your Your ComfyUI root directory, for my example:
cd C:\Users\reall\Softwares\ComfyUI_windows_portable 

conda create -p ./python_miniconda_env/ComfyUI python=3.11

# conda will tell what command to use to activate the env
conda activate C:\Users\reall\Softwares\ComfyUI_windows_portable\python_miniconda_env\ComfyUI

# update pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# You can using following command to installing CUDA only in the miniconda environment you just created if you don't want to donwload and install it manually & globally:
# conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-12.1.0" cuda-toolkit

# Install the main packahes
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

pip install -r ./ComfyUI/requirements.txt

# Then go to ComfyUI-3D-Pack directory under the ComfyUI Root Directory\ComfyUI\custom_nodes for my example is:
cd C:\Users\reall\Softwares\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-3D-Pack
```

   - Alternatively you can check this tutorial: [Installing ComfyUI with Miniconda On Windows and Mac](https://www.comflowy.com/preparation-for-study/install#step-two-download-comfyui)
  
#### Install with Miniconda:
Go to the Comfy3D root directory: *ComfyUI Root Directory\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-3D-Pack* and run:

```bash
install_miniconda.bat
```
Just in case `install_miniconda.bat` may not working in your OS, you could also run the following commands under the same directory: (Works with Linux & macOS)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements_post.txt
```
<br>

**Plus:**<br>
- For those who want to run it inside Google Colab, you can check the [install instruction from @lovisdotio](https://github.com/MrForExample/ComfyUI-3D-Pack/issues/13)
- You can find some of the pre-build wheels for Linux here: [remsky/ComfyUI3D-Assorted-Wheels](https://github.com/remsky/ComfyUI3D-Assorted-Wheels)

#### Install and run with docker:

Gpu support during Docker build time is required to install all requirenents. 
On Linux host you could setup `nvidia-container-runtime`. On Windows
it is quite different and not checked at moment.

##### Linux setup:

1. Install nvidia-container-runtime:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install nvidia-container-runtime
    ```

1. Edit/create the /etc/docker/daemon.json with content:
    ```json
    {
        "runtimes": {
            "nvidia": {
                "path": "/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime",
                "runtimeArgs": []
            } 
        },
        "default-runtime": "nvidia" 
    }
    ```
    
1. Restart docker daemon:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```

Finally build and run docker container with:
```bash
docker build -t comfy3d . && docker run --rm -it -p 8188:8188 --gpus all comfy3d
```

## Run:
Copy the files inside folder [__New_ComfyUI_Bats](./_New_ComfyUI_Bats/) to your ComfyUI root directory, and double click run_nvidia_gpu_miniconda.bat to start ComfyUI!
- Alternatively you can just activate the Conda env: `python_miniconda_env\ComfyUI`, and go to your ComfyUI root directory then run command `python ./ComfyUI/main.py`

  /                /           
 +z               forward           

elevation: in (-90, 90), from +y to -y is (-90, 90)
azimuth: in (-180, 180), from +z to +x is (0, 90)
```

* Wonder3D world & camera coordinate system:

* Three.js coordinate system: (z-axis is pointing towards you and is coming out of the screen)

![right_hand_coordinate_system](_Example_Workflows/_Example_Outputs/right_hand_coordinate_system.png)

* If you encounter OpenGL errors (e.g., `[F glutil.cpp:338] eglInitialize() failed`), then set `force_cuda_rasterize` to true on corresponding node
* If after the installation, your ComfyUI get stucked at starting or running, you could following the instruction in following link to solve the problem: [Code Hangs Indefinitely When Evaluating Neuron Models on GPU](https://github.com/lava-nc/lava-dl/discussions/211)
